# seedling-deploy

With **Anaconda**, you can quickly build and run the entire application in minutes :

```shell
# 1. First, clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/dbmohit/seedling-deploy.git
$ cd seedling-deploy

# 2. install anaconda and go to anaconda prompt and cd file location
$ flask run

# 3. Run!
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and wait till the webpage is loaded.

## Local Installation

It's easy to install and run it on your computer.

```shell
# 1. First, clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/dbmohit/seedling-deploy.git
$ cd seedling-deploy

# 2. Install Python packages
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run!
$ python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and have fun. :smiley:

## Customization

It's also easy to customize and include your models in this app.

<details>
 <summary>Details</summary>

### Use your own model

Place your trained `.h5` file saved by `model.save()` under models directory.

Check the [commented code](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp/blob/master/app.py#L37) in app.py.

### Use other pre-trained model

See [Keras applications](https://keras.io/applications/) for more available models such as DenseNet, MobilNet, NASNet, etc.

Check [this section](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp/blob/master/app.py#L26) in app.py.

### UI Modification

Modify files in `templates` and `static` directory.

`index.html` for the UI and `main.js` for all the behaviors.

## Deployment

To deploy it for public use, you need to have a public **linux server**.

### Run the app

Run the script and hide it in background with `tmux` or `screen`.
```
$ python app.py
```

You can also use gunicorn instead of gevent
```
$ gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:5000 app:app
```

More deployment options, check [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/wsgi-standalone/)

### Set up Nginx

To redirect the traffic to your local app.
Configure your Nginx `.conf` file.

```
server {
  listen  80;

  client_max_body_size 20M;

  location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
  }
}
```

## Future Plan

- [ ] Support detection and segmentation models
